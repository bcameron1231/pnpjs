# Transition Guide V3 -> V4

    **For more information about migrating from an earlier version of PnPjs please see the transition guides below**

    - [V2 -> V3 Transition Guide](https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/v3/transition-guide/)
    - [V1 -> V2 Transition Guide](https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/v2/transition-guide/)

It is our hope that the transition from version 3.\* to 4.\* will be as painless as possible as the changes we have made are not as extensive as with version 3. Below are some highlights of the most disruptive changes that were made. For a full, detailed list of what's been added, updated, and removed please see our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## SharePoint Taxonomy has moved to @pnp/graph from @pnp/sp

To better support Taxonomy authentication and control we've moved our Taxonomy implementation from the @pnp/sp module to the @pnp/graph module. We were utilizing the v2.x endpoints to continue to support taxonomy in the SharePoint bundle and we decided that this was not the best approach. You will need to update your taxonomy implementations to use the graph endpoints.

## Add/Update methods no longer returning data and a queryable instance

The primary breaking change will be with add and update method return values. We are not going to return what the calling endpoint returns so anywhere that you are referencing the return objects `data` property you will need to remove that reference. Many of the graph endpoints do return the added or updated object but most of the SharePoint ones return 204, which would translate into a return type of void.

Ex:

    ```TypeScript
    // Version 3 
    const update = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle("My List").items.getById(1).update({Title: "My New Title"});
    const newTitle = update.data.Title;

    // Version 4
    await sp.web.lists.getByTitle("My List").items.getById(1)..update({Title: "My New Title"});
    const updatedItem = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle("My List").items.getById(1)();
    ```

## Async Iterator Pattern

As an updated pattern we are recommending you move to an async iterator pattern to get more than 5000 items from a list.

With that in mind we've removed the `/items/get-all` endpoint. In addition we've updated the @pnp/sp package's `IItems` and `_Items` collections as well as the @pnp/graph `IGraphQueryableCollection` to support the async iterator pattern.

Check out this example for more information on this pattern: [Get Paged Items](./sp/items.md#get-paged-items).
